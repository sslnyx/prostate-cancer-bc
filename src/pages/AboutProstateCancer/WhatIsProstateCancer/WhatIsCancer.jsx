            Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control.
            When cancer starts in the prostate, itâ€™s called prostate cancer.
            Prostate cancer can be either localized or advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Localized prostate cancer refers to cancer that has not grown beyond
            the prostate. It generally has no symptoms (asymptomatic) and does
            not often end up spreading beyond the prostate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advanced prostate cancer refers to cancer that has spread
            (metastasized) beyond the prostate including into surrounding
            tissues, bones, and/or lymph nodes. Advanced cancer can be
            high-risk, complex, and castrate-resistant. For more information and
            to receive specialized support for advanced cancer, please visit our
