            <p>
              Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of
              control. When cancer starts in the prostate, itâ€™s called prostate
              cancer. Prostate cancer can be either localized or advanced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Localized prostate cancer refers to cancer that has not grown
              beyond the prostate. It generally has no symptoms (asymptomatic)
              and does not often end up spreading beyond the prostate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Advanced prostate cancer refers to cancer that has spread
              (metastasized) beyond the prostate including into surrounding
              tissues, bones, and/or lymph nodes. Advanced cancer can be
              high-risk, complex, and castrate-resistant. For more information
              and to receive specialized support for advanced cancer, please
